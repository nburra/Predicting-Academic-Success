The data is from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository which measures a variety of variables. The relationship between a studentâ€™s first semester GPA and admission grade was most effective. The data was parsed into two lists using a custom read_file function. The visualization through scatter plots and regression lines used Matplotlib and NumPy. Statistical analysis was conducted using SciPy.Stats (skew, mean, median, confidence intervals). The results showed a positive correlation of 0.14 between admission grades and first-semester GPA. This correlation is weak (smaller slope of regression line). There was also a higher density of students with admission grade 126.1 and 12.3 GPA and a slightly stronger correlation for higher admission grades (120-200 range). The weak correlation suggests admission grades alone are not strong predictors. Teachers can prioritize students with lower admission grades to improve study habits and test preparation. Thus, multiple factors influence academic success, requiring a holistic approach. This data can help identify areas for improvement and targeted interventions in educational institutions.
